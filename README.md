# CECS_543_SCM
Source Code Management Project for CECS 543

## Introduction

The finished product will be an SCM (Source Code Management) project. The first part of the project implemented will be the initial use-case: Create Repo. To get working software quickly, we will code using MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and code mainly focused on the "success path" of a user scenario. The SCM repository will eventually hold multiple versions of a given file which is why a weighted checksum is used to give a each file (artifact) a unique ID.
